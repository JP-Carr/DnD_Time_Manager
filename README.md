# D&D Time Manager
D&D Time Manager is a simple application created for Microsoft Windows to allow Dungeon Masters to keep track of in-game events and the times at which they occured. It also automates the rolling of local weather conditions as outlined in ch. 5 of the the Dungeon Master's Guide (with a few small tweaks).

## Installation
At present D&DTM is only available  as a standalone .zip archive for Microsoft Windows. Download the [Latest Release](https://github.com/JP-Carr/DnD_Time_Manager/releases/latest), simply unzip the archive in your chosen directory and you're good to go.

## Usage
To start the program, run "DnD_Time_Manager.exe". This will present you with the app's GUI:

#### Layout
* Row 1 - In-game time: Time(hh:mm), Day, Tenday, Month, Year
* Row 2 - Temperature and precipitation level
* Row 3 - Wind Speed and direction
* Row 4 - Hour change input, Day change input, Submit time change (change can be any positive or negative integer)
* Row 5 - Log input box, Enter log, open log.txt
-----------------------------------
Entering values in the time input boxes and clicking "Submit" will update the in-game time. Weather conditions are automatically rolled on a day change.
The "Log" function allows for notes to be recorded from the GUI, the log is stored alongside the in-game time and date for easy reference.
